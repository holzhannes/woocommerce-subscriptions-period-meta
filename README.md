# Woocommerce Subscriptions Period Meta

This Plugin will add the subscription period as meta value to every WooCommerce Subscription & Order items. It will also display the last possible termination date calculated by `next_payment_date - notice_period` (1 Month). If the Subscription has a termination date this will be printed to item meta instead.
